# Internal-Cycloidal-Actuator
Having designed many robotic actuators, one recurring issue that I found is compactness. Ideally, a robotic actuator should be as slim as possible, especially for legged robots. To fix this, I decided to try a new design approach. Instead of using an off-the-shelf motor for the actuator, I decided to build my own motor so that the gearbox can rest in the center thus making the actuator compact. In my opinion, this is the optimal actuator design as you can retain the power output of an off-the-shelf motor while making the acuator slimmer. I first saw this design scheme implemented in the MIT Mini Cheetah robot which has a 6:1 internal planetary gear set in the center of its actuators. This actuator uses an 8:1 cycloidal drive.
